# Lab Report 5: Debugging
In this lab report I will focus on debugging. It will include the interactions between a student and a TA trying to work out bugs within a program.

## Part 1: Student Question in Edstem

***What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?***
I am using a Macbook on MacOS in Visual Studio Code.

***Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.***
I am writing a partition algorithm that takes the center element in the array and is supposed to partition the elements within the array so that every element to the left of the initial center element(pivot) is less than it and every element to the right of the initial element(pivot) is greater than it.
